## 🛠 Technologies I Use

I focus on building **scalable, maintainable, and high-performance** applications. Here are the key technologies I work with:

### 🔹 **Full-Stack & Front-End Stack**
- **Next.js** – Fast, scalable React framework.
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for better maintainability.
- **React.js** – For building interactive UIs.
- **Tailwind CSS & Bootstrap** – For fast and beautiful styling.
- **Node.js & Express** – Backend services and API development.
- **MySQL & MongoDB** – Databases for scalable applications.
- **Firebase & Supabase** – Authentication and database solutions.

### 🔹 **Development Workflow**
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration.
- **VS Code** – My go-to code editor.
- **Vite & Webpack** – Super-fast builds.
- **ESLint & Prettier** – Code quality and formatting.

## ❓ FAQs

### ❔ Why use Next.js instead of React.js?
Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and automatic code splitting, making applications faster and SEO-friendly.

### ❔ Can I use these projects commercially?
Yes! Feel free to modify and use them in your own projects. Just give credit where it's due. 😊

### ❔ What if I run into issues?
Open a GitHub issue or reach out via email.
